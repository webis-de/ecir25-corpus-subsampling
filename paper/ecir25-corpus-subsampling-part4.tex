{\color{red}} TODO: use the measure mentioned by Guido that takes into account score ties etc.

\subsection{The Effect of First-Stage Retrievers}

Green IR Experiments here.
Maybe 50\% from the corpus subsample, 50\% random

\subsection{Cascading Re-Ranking Pipelines}

As many retrieval pipelines are cascading, we also test how corpus subsampling impacts the resource consumption of cascading re-ranking pipelines. Given that corpus subsampling directly impacts the resource consumption for the first stage, it substantially impacts also the impact of re-ranking pipelines, as is becomes more simple to show that subsequent stages are more robust for switching the first stage re-ranker. E.g., the approach for efficient xy means z.

Pipeline:
- run multiple first stages
- combine union of first stage outputs, score all of them
- simulate re-ranking via tabulation
